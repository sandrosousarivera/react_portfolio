# Personal Web Portfolio 🧑🏼‍💻💼📝

This is my personal web portfolio, where I showcase my skills, projects, and professional information. It serves as a central hub for anyone interested in learning more about my work.

Previously, I built my portfolio using **Vanilla JavaScript**, HTML5, and CSS, but I am now updating and improving it with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a more modern, scalable, and maintainable approach.

## Features

  Switch between light and dark themes.

**Navigation Menu** 🧭  
Easy-to-use navigation for smooth site browsing.

- **Smooth Transitions and Animations** ✨  
  Enjoy a modern, interactive user experience with smooth transitions and animations.

- **Version Upgrade**  
  Transitioning from a **Vanilla JS** version to a more robust and scalable **React + Tailwind CSS** setup.
